# Vortex RISC-V ISA Manual

## Overview

This repo contains a snapshot of the RISC-V ISA Manual for Vortex 2.X

The snapshots originate from this _live_ Overleaf document. However, since the Overleaf is a student account there is no gaurantee that it will persist after the student(s) graduate. Therefore, periodic snapshots are kept here.

## Contribution

As long as there is a functioning live Overleaf link, you should use it for development. After you make your changes, it is recommended that you backup all the files (at least the ones that you changed) in this repo on github. To summarize, use live Overleaf link to make changes. Once your changes are completed you should manually update this repo with the new files.

### Manual Syncing

Overleaf lets you download a zipfile of the entire project (_Menu > Downloads > Source_). While it is easier to just zip the project and upload it here. Please try to sync just the files that you changed so that the git diffs are sensible when viewed from this repo. For example, if you just made changes in `main.tex` then just copy and paste that file here. No need to copy other unchanged files in or complete zip files in.

## Local Setup & Configuration (Optional)

This document is compiled with the (default) pdfLatex compiler on Overleaf, however most LaTeX compilers should work. You can choose to configure your own local LaTeX development environment. Please prioritize updating the Overleaf first and manually syncing changes into this git repo.

## Live Overleaf Link Dead

If the live Overleaf link is dead, then this repo is the quickest way to track down the most recent source code for the manual. You should take the initiative to create a shared Overleaf project (Hint: zip this complete repo and upload directly to Overleaf) and update the Overleaf link. If you need to update the Overleaf link, please note your name and email in case there are any issues.
